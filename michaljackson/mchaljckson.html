<h1>Merry Christmas</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to the website of facts! If anything I bet you people or not people wern't thinking that this would be a website about Michael Jackson or any other famous person! (Trust me it doesn't have
to be a dead person.) What I am going to do is make a article about Michael Jackson! What I mean by "facts" about Michael Jackson is how old he was when he died and stuff like that including his dance moves and
how he did some of that stuff like the gravity lean!</p>
<h1>Date of birth ands death of Michael Jackson!</h1>
<p>Michael Jackson was born on August 29, 1958 which was about.. no... it was exactly 60 years ago so we now know that he died before he was 60! that is 
very young for somebody to die. But when he actually died in June 25, 2009, so he died when he was about 51! not so young for somebody to die even though 
he did a whole bunch of dance moves and SHOULD have died later!</p>
<h1>How he died</h1>
<p>In the last paragraph I said that he died when he was 51 and that was young. Well for him I guess it wasn't because
he died from cardiac arrest. The reason he died from cardiac arrest is because the docter Michael Jackson was seeing 
was giving him medicine that he didn't need!!! When he had to take the medicine he overdosed with to many drugs in his systems
and turned up dead! What a terrible way for the guy who created a dance move called the gravity lean to die like that!</p>
<h1>How he did the Gravity Lean!</h1>
<p>What all of you have been waiting for... How Michael Jackson did the gravity lean!! What he did he got a system in the stage that has a movable 
thing that held his center of mass and lets him change it. He also got a special kind of shoe that clicked into the thing in the stage. Sometimes while 
he was practicing it would break and he would fall flat on his face!</p>
